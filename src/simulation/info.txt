gtrteimo: All Future CUDA stuff here if possible

21ChiNat: NO. Everything shall be CUDA and CUDA shall be everything

gtrteimo: AMD??? Intel?? Whatever else exists?? Not everyone has a Nvidia GPU!
            We are doing cross platform so why can't we also be hardware independent.
            At least make it optional with something like a CMake variable/option at compile time or just another branch!

21ChiNat: OK. I will make it hardware independent (huge pain in the ass), after it works with CUDA. 
            As you can see this is now in the CUDA branch and is using a completely different methodology for
            storing particles. just know much will change in this branch since openGL can be run on the GPU.
            Also i deleted the info.txt in the include so i know where to expect the continuation of this discussion.
            About CMake variable/option i have no idea how to do that but i know who knows. Anyways this branch should
            compile before i think about that.
